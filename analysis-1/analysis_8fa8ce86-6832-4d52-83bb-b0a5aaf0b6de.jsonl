Such validations, among other things should check for data type validations, min/max value, exceptions, etc.\n(iii) Ensure necessary data validation/checks in the system for the data keyed in manually, wherever applicable. For example, such validations with master data (or parameters used in asset classification fed into the System as per the internal policy of the bank) could prevent issues related to incorrect entries generally seen (illustrative but not exhaustive list) in margin setting, moratorium period, security valuation, repayment schedule, products mapped / linked to different categories of account holders (as per applicability) etc.\n(iv) Data input shall be effected only after authentication and authorisation.\n(2) User Access Management\n(i) Ensure that all ‘user-IDs' in the System have unique identification. If there are any generic user-IDs used, it shall only be used under exceptional circumstances and such ids shall be mandatorily mapped to the employee ID of the user to fix accountability of the activities carried-out under the generic ID.\n(ii) Provide for two-factor or higher level of authentication for the users of the application.\n(iii) Restrict the access to the System on 'need to have / least privilege' basis for all users.\n(iv) Provide for maker checker authorisation / control for transactions (an illustrative list of transactions includes updating/modifying the internal accounts, customer accounts, parameters – both financial and non-financial that affect the status of the credit portfolio / loan / asset) entered in the System.

The System should provide for changes to the data items only through front end (from the application (eg: CBS) itself and not through the backend database update) after requisite authorisation. Audit trails / logs of access, changes to any data, parameters, if any, should be captured with specific user details in the system.\n(ii) In case of exceptions in rare circumstances, such changes shall be duly approved at an appropriate level and documented. Provision for MIS report should be available to auditors to generate complete list of back-end access and changes made.\n(5) Audit Logs\n(i) Provisions of audit trails / logs to capture details of mandatory fields (that are essential to complete the transaction and essential to identify the transaction for audit / forensic purpose in the future) of all the transactions (financial and non-financial) shall be made.\n(ii) Logs shall be maintained for changing the master data.
