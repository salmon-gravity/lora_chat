(5) Poultry and Piggery: For poultry, piggery and rearing of goats, loans will be considered as per norms of different banks. (6) Fisheries: In the case of borrowers who have lost their boats, nets and other equipment, re-phasing of payment of existing dues may be allowed on merits. Fresh loans may be granted to them with loan maturity of 3/4 years. Loans for repairs to boats of the existing borrowers may also be considered.

In States where substantial subsidy towards cost of boats, nets, etc. is likely to be available, proper co-ordination with the State Government Department concerned in this regard must be ensured. Apart from complying with other norms and conditions for grant of advances, assistance may be sought from the Department of Fisheries, which may be expected to take measures which would enable banks to proceed with financing for this purpose. The boats should be comprehensively insured against all risks including natural calamities as far as possible.","circular_name":"Reserve Bank of India (Urban Co-operative Banks – Resolution of Stressed Assets) Directions, 2025"},{"action_point":"'Smaller entities' in the context of 'Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure' shall mean those entities on which total exposure of the banking system is at ₹50 crore or less","circular_name":"Reserve Bank of India (Small Finance Banks – Credit Risk Management) Directions, 2025"},{"action_point":"Any commercial communication can only take place using registered Headers assigned to the PEs (such as Banks, Mutual Funds, Insurance Companies, Mutual funds, Stockbrokers, other Financial Institutions, Corporates, Enterprises, SMEs, big and small businesses, and any entity who wishes to send commercial communication to its existing or prospective customers) for the purpose of commercial communications.","circular_name":"Prevention of financial frauds perpetrated using voice calls and SMS – Regulatory prescriptions and Institutional Safeguards"},{"action_point":"(7) Card Loyalty / Reward Programme/s are those schemes linked to a credit card whereby the card-issuer or associated merchant establishments, upon use of the card/s, offer digital coupons, points, discounts, cash backs or other benefits having monetary value that can be used/redeemed for the same transactions or other future transactions after accumulation.","circular_name":"Reserve Bank of India (Non-Banking Financial Companies – Credit Cards: Issuance and Conduct) Directions, 2025"},{"action_point":"(2) The portfolio over which DLG can be offered shall consist of identifiable and measurable loan assets which have been sanctioned (the ‘DLG set').

In case a deposit, hitherto excluded from LCR computation (for instance a non-callable fixed deposit), is contractually pledged as a collateral to secure a credit facility or loan, such deposit shall be treated as callable for LCR purposes and provisions of the above points (a) and (b) shall apply.","circular_name":"Basel III Framework on Liquidity Standards – Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) – Review of haircuts on High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) and review of composition and run-off rates on certain categories of deposits"},{"action_point":"93.
