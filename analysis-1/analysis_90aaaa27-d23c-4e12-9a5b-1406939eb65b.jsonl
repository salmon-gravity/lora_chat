(ii) If the borrower has already taken a term loan against mortgage / charge on land, the bank should be content with a second charge for the converted term loan. (iii) banks should not insist on third party guarantees for providing conversion facilities. (iv) In the case of term loans for replacement of equipment, repairs, etc. and for working capital finance to artisans and self-employed persons or for crop loans, usual security may be obtained.
