Illustratively, if, at the time of the bond issue, the difference between the pre-enhanced and the enhanced rating was four notches (taking into account the rating qualifiers) and the enhanced rating subsequently undergoes a change, the notional reference rating will be arrived at by deducting four notches from the changed rating, The absolute value of the difference between the capital requirement corresponding to the notional reference rating thus arrived at, and the current/ revised rating of the bond will give the aggregate capital required to be maintained by the PCE providing banks, subject to a floor, i.e., the capital requirement on the PCE at the time of issuance of the PCE enhanced bonds. Additionally, corporate bonds, to be eligible for PCE from banks, shall be rated by a minimum of two external credit rating agencies at all times. The rating reports, both initial and subsequent, shall disclose both standalone credit rating (i.e., rating without taking into account the effect of PCE) as well as the enhanced credit rating (taking into account the effect of PCE). Further, for the purpose of capital computation in the books of PCE provider, lower of the two standalone credit ratings and the corresponding enhanced credit rating of the same rating agency shall be reckoned. Where the reassessed standalone credit rating at any time during the life of the bond shows improvement over the corresponding rating at the time of bond issuance, the capital requirement may be recalculated on the basis of the reassessed standalone credit rating and the reassessed enhanced credit rating, without reference to the constraints of capital floor and difference in notches.\n(2) As long as the bond outstanding amount exceeds the aggregate PCE (drawn and contingent non- funded) offered, the capital held should not be less than the amount required to be held at the time of issuance of the PCE enhanced bond. However, once the bond outstanding has amortised below the aggregate PCE amount, the capital can be computed taking into account the outstanding bond amount.\n(3) In situations where the notional pre-enhanced rating of the bond, slips below investment grade (BBB minus), capital must be maintained as per risk weight of 1250% on the amount of PCE provided.","circular_name":"Reserve Bank of India (Commercial Banks – Credit Facilities) Directions, 2025"},{"action_point":"54.

However, in rare cases, where a bank needs to issue non-voting common shares as part of CET 1 capital, they shall be identical to voting common shares of the issuing bank in all respects except the absence of voting rights. Limit on voting rights shall be applicable based on the provisions of respective statutes governing a bank; (ii) Represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the bank; (iii) Entitled to a claim on the residual assets which is proportional to its share of paid-up capital, after all senior claims have been repaid in liquidation (i.e., has an unlimited and variable claim, not a fixed or capped claim); (iv) Principal is perpetual and never repaid outside of liquidation (except discretionary repurchases / buy backs or other means of effectively reducing capital in a discretionary manner that is allowable under relevant law as well as guidelines, if any, issued by the Reserve Bank in the matter); (v) The bank does nothing to create an expectation at issuance that the instrument shall be bought back, redeemed, or cancelled nor do the statutory or contractual terms provide any feature which might give rise to such an expectation; (vi) Distributions are paid out of distributable items. The level of distributions is not in any way tied or linked to the amount paid up at issuance and is not subject to a contractual cap (except to the extent that a bank is unable to pay distributions that exceed the level of distributable items). As regards ‘distributable items’, dividend on common shares shall be paid out of current year’s profit only; (vii) There are no circumstances under which the distributions are obligatory. Non-payment therefore shall not be an event of default; (viii) Distributions are paid only after all legal and contractual obligations have been met and payments on more senior capital instruments have been made. This means that there are no preferential distributions, including in respect of other elements classified as the highest quality issued capital; (ix) It is the paid-up capital that takes the first and proportionately greatest share of any losses as they occur. Within the highest quality capital, each instrument absorbs losses on a going concern basis proportionately and pari passu with all the others. In cases where capital instruments have a permanent write-down feature, this criterion is still deemed to be met by common shares; (x) The paid-up amount is classified as equity capital (i.e., not recognised as a liability) for determining balance sheet insolvency; (xi) The paid-up amount is classified as equity under the relevant Accounting Standards; (xii) It is directly issued and paid up and the bank cannot directly or indirectly have funded the purchase of the instrument. A bank shall not grant advances against its own shares as this would be construed as indirect funding of its own capital. A bank shall also not extend loans against its own shares; (xiii) The paid-up amount is neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of the issuer or related entity nor subject to any other arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of the claim; (xiv) Paid-up capital is only issued with the approval of the owners of the issuing bank, either given directly by the owners or, if permitted by applicable law, given by the Board of Directors or by other persons duly authorised by the owners; and (xv) Paid-up capital is clearly and separately disclosed in the bank’s Balance Sheet.","circular_name":"Reserve Bank of India (Payments Banks– Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy) Directions, 2025"},{"action_point":"23.
