Securitisation – External Ratings Based Approach (SEC-ERBA)\nFor securitisation exposures that are externally rated, risk-weighted assets under the securitisation external ratings-based approach (SEC-ERBA) will be determined by multiplying securitisation exposure amounts by the appropriate risk weights provided that the following operational criteria are met:\na. To be eligible for risk-weighting purposes, the external credit assessment must take into account and reflect the entire amount of credit risk exposure the lender has with regard to all payments owed to it.\nb. The external credit assessments must be from an eligible external credit rating agency (CRA) as provided in Paragraph 6 of the “Master Circular – Basel III Capital Regulations” dated July 1, 2015 (as amended from time to time). A rating must be published in a publicly accessible form and included in the CRA's transition matrix. Also, loss and cash flow analysis as well as sensitivity of ratings to changes in the underlying rating assumptions should be publicly available. The external credit assessment provided by the eligible CRAs should not be more than six months old.\nc. Eligible CRAs must have a demonstrated expertise in assessing securitisations, which may be evidenced by strong market acceptance.\nd. A bank cannot use the credit assessments issued by one external credit rating agency for one or more tranches and those of another external credit rating agency for other positions within the same securitisation structure. Where two or more eligible CRAs can be used and these assess the credit risk of the same securitisation exposure differently, Paragraph 6.7 of the “Master Circular – Basel III Capital Regulations” dated July 1, 2015 will apply.\ne. Where credit risk mitigation (CRM) is provided to specific underlying exposures or the entire pool by an eligible guarantor and is reflected in the external credit assessment assigned to a securitisation exposure(s), the risk weight associated with that external credit assessment should be used. No additional capital recognition is permitted.\nf. In the situation where a credit risk mitigant solely protects a specific securitisation exposure within a given structure and this protection is reflected in the external credit assessment, the lender must treat the exposure as if it is unrated and then apply the CRM treatment outlined in Paragraph 7 of the “Master Circular – Basel III Capital Regulations” dated July 1, 2015 (as amended from time to time).\ng. A lender is not permitted to use any external credit assessment for risk-weighting purposes where the assessment is at least partly based on unfunded support provided by the lender. The lender must treat the ABS as if it were not rated and must continue to hold capital against the other securitisation exposures it provides.","circular_name":"Master Direction – Reserve Bank of India (Securitisation of Standard Assets) Directions, 2021"},{"action_point":"For STC securitisation exposures with short-term ratings, a risk weight of 60% shall apply for an external credit assessment of A3.","circular_name":"Reserve Bank of India (Non-Banking Financial Companies – Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy) Directions, 2025"},{"action_point":"The promoting / converting entity must declare the source of funds for the aggregate shareholding in the bank as indicated in the declaration of aggregate proposed shareholding, duly certified by the Chartered Accountant.","circular_name":"Reserve Bank of India (Small Finance Banks – Licensing) Guidelines, 2025"},{"action_point":"Whether a promoter ceases to be a promoter or could exit from the bank, after completing the lock-in period of five years, would depend on the RBI's regulatory and supervisory comfort / discomfort and SEBI regulations in this regard at that time.","circular_name":"Reserve Bank of India (Small Finance Banks – Licensing) Guidelines, 2025"},{"action_point":"A.1 Existing Structure\n2.
